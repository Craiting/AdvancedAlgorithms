## DNA Analysis Lab

#### Results
I ran all my comparisons at once using the supercomputers which us students have
access to. The setup for running them is found in the compare.py, pair.py,
jobs/queuejobs.py and jobs/compare.sh files. The text files showing how the
scoring is done with the final score as the last line are all found in the
results directory. Tables are included at the same level as this file.
